The Project :

This project aimed at better understanding the evolution of the climate in France since 1975. To do that, NOAA database (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) were fetched containing monthly Precipitation (PRCP), Extreme Maximum Daily Precipitation (EMXP) and Temperature Minimum (TMIN), Mean (TAVG) and Maximum (TMAX). 
These data enabled to address the following questions :
-	Is the precipitation correlated to other climatic variables ?
-	Has the Mean Temperature been raising since 1975 like it is said in the newpapers ?
-	Can we predict the future Mean Temperature in France for the next 36 months ?
The structure, results and summary of the project are shared in the corresponding file ‘Results&Interpretation’ so do not hesitate to check as well.


The aim of this work :

The real goal of this project was firstly to strenghten the Python skills I have learned in one month studying a ‘Python for Data Science’ course. Hence, I mostly wanted to work with data seeking, data manipulation and visualization. I was also looking for seasonnal time series dataset where I could deal with PCA, Linear Regression and forecasting.
This project was a great way to developp my curiosity for Data Science. It taught me initiative spirit to resolve problems about programming skills and mathematical skills. 
Lastly, this work intends to show my motivation and my way to work for any kind of recruiter about Data Science and/or Environmental Sciences.
